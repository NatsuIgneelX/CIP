# Code In Place 2023
These are the projects that I have completed as part of my learning in Stanford's Code in Place 2023 course. 
Code in Place is an introduction to programming course that covers the material from the first half of Stanford's CS106A Programming Methodologies. 
The class emphasizes the fundamentals of programming including: control flow, loops and conditionals, console programs with variables, graphics, lists and dictionaries. 
The course is taught in the Python programming language. To complete the course students must program a significant implementation in each of the following units: Unit 1: Karel the Robot Unit 2: Console Programming Unit 3: Graphics, Lists, and Dictionaries, Section Participation which are weekly live interactive sessions with a section leader who is in charge of our tutorials.  
There are 9000 - 10000 students that took part in the online course and there are over 70,000 students that started an application. The acceptance is < 14.3% if 10000 students and < 12.9% if 9000 students.
